# AOTW_Week5

## Explanation and rules

AOTW is a recurring series I would like to try. The acronym stands for **App Of The Week**.
The premise is very simple: every week, I have a new assignment—an application of some sort.
The first few days are spent ensuring that the most basic functions of the app are acceptable.
This is the end goal. Once the main end goal has been reached, I add stretch goals.

This week I have decided to make some changes to better fit my schedule. Now I can choose 
optional days as my schedule allows and I must make 5 commits with only 1 counting per
day. This should help free up my schedule. Initially, I choose to make the weekends  
to be optional but having 2 days of my choice is better for my schedule.

## This week’s app is: :sparkles: a new portfolio website :sparkles:
The base goal is to create a simple portfolio website 
I want it to be infinite scrolling and to look reasonably well desgined
It should include my top picks of my github projects as well as contact info

**Stretch goals will be added here:**
